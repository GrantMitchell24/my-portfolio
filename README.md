This is My Portfolio. This is designed to tell a litle bit about myself, along with some of my interests in the "work" section. I also have a link to my first GitHub project in the first large card icon. 

The website has a functional header, that will direct you to About Me, My Work, Contact Information, and my Resume. The the "Work" section, the first card has my first project on GitHub. The next 3 are some of my interests, weather, gaming and NFL. The last card has a link to Yahoo. The footer has all of my contact information along with icons to simply go to designated location.
